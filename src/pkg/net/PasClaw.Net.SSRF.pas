(*
  PasClaw.Net.SSRF - Server-Side Request Forgery guard for outbound
  URL fetches.

  The model can hand any URL to web_fetch. Without this guard, an
  agent running on (e.g.) an EC2 instance can be tricked into
  fetching http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-
  credentials/<role> and leaking the instance's temporary AWS
  credentials. Same trick works against GCP / Azure metadata, against
  internal services on the operator's LAN, and against localhost
  services (Postgres on 5432, Redis on 6379, etc.) that were never
  meant to be reachable by the model.

  The guard does two things:

    1. Pre-check: parse the URL, resolve the hostname to one or more
       IPv4 addresses, refuse if ANY of them fall in a blocked range.
       "Any" so a DNS record with both public and private A records
       can't smuggle a request through.

    2. Redirect re-check: after a 3xx redirect, the agent's HTTP
       client re-resolves the new target. The redirect handler in
       web_fetch wires URLIsLocal in so a public->private redirect
       gets aborted mid-flight.

  Known gaps (intentional, documented for the security-conscious):

    - IPv6 hosts are not blocklisted. The most common attack
      vectors (cloud metadata, internal LAN services, localhost
      ports) all surface on IPv4. Adding v6 ranges (::1, fc00::/7,
      fe80::/10, ::ffff:0:0/96 IPv4-mapped, etc.) is straightforward
      when someone reports a v6-specific incident.

    - DNS rebinding: this guard re-resolves at request time, not
      at every TCP packet. A determined attacker could swap the A
      record between the pre-check and the actual connect.
      Mitigation requires pinning the TCP connection to the IP
      that passed validation, which Indy doesn't make easy.
      Accepted residual risk; same gap picoclaw ships with.
