  PasClaw.Tools.Sandbox - tool-side enforcement for the workspace
  boundary and shell denylist documented in TSandboxPolicy
  (PasClaw.Config).

  The previous shell tool shipped six substring checks (rm -rf /,
  mkfs, dd if=, fork bomb, shutdown -h) and the FS tools had no path
  check at all — the unit header in PasClaw.Tools.FS.pas said
  "Paths are not sandboxed by default; the gateway will install a
  workspace-restricted variant in Phase 4" and that variant was
  never written. This unit is that variant.

  Architecture: module-level GPolicy / GWorkspace, set once via
  Configure() from each command's startup. Tool handlers receive
  only an ArgsJSON string — there is no provider context to plumb a
  policy through, so a module-level singleton is the only option.
  Configure() is idempotent and may be called repeatedly; the most
  recent call wins.

  Three checks exposed:

    CanReadPath  - fs_read, fs_list, fs_grep call this on every
                   path argument before doing I/O.
    CanWritePath - fs_write, fs_edit_hashline (write side), the
                   append helper.
    ShellAllowed - shell_exec calls this on the raw command string.

  Each returns False with a Reason filled in. The handler converts
  Reason into an error string the model sees so it can adjust its
  next turn instead of looping on a silent failure.

  Allowlist style: AllowReadPaths / AllowWritePaths are real PCRE
  regex patterns. PasClaw.Tools.Regex wraps FPC's RegExpr and
  Delphi's System.RegularExpressions behind one call so config.json
  takes the same syntax as picoclaw's tools.allow_read_paths /
  tools.allow_write_paths — anchors (^ $), character classes,
  alternation, etc. Empty / invalid patterns fall through to the
  workspace boundary instead of crashing the agent.

  Shell denylist style: a list of "forbidden tokens" matched against
  the command's whitespace-split tokens (sudo, rm, cd, del, format,
  ...) plus a list of "forbidden substrings" matched against the
  lowercased command (dd if=, $( , | sh, powershell -e, ...). The
  token list and substring list cover both POSIX shells and cmd /
  PowerShell, so the policy is consistent regardless of where
  shell_exec eventually lands. Coverage is documented inline next
  to each entry; adding a case requires only one array entry.

  Workspace pinning: when RestrictToWorkspace is on, Tool_Shell
  passes CurrentWorkspace into RunOneShot so the child shell starts
  inside the workspace. Combined with the cd / chdir / pushd / popd
  token denylist and the '..' traversal check, this closes the
  relative-path bypass — a model that says "cat ../secret" hits the
  refusal before the process spawns, and even if a pattern slips
  through the denylist, the shell's cwd is the workspace, not
  whatever directory the user happened to invoke pasclaw from.

  Canonicalization: ExpandFileName resolves '..' and relative
  references against the current working directory. Symlinks
  pointing outside the workspace can still escape on platforms
  where the OS does not normalize them at the syscall layer —
  picoclaw avoids that via Go 1.24's os.OpenRoot, which we do not
  have an equivalent for in FPC/Delphi RTL. The README's Security
  section flags this as a known limitation.

  { Tokens that, when found as a whitespace-separated word in the
    command, abort the call. The denylist tries to be conservative —
    these are commands the model has no business running from a
    chat session even on a developer workstation.

    A few legit-sounding cases (e.g. `chmod +x build.sh`) are caught
    too. That is intentional: the model can write the file and the
    human can chmod it. Override per-config via custom_shell_deny
    if a specific case is needed. }
  (*  Tokens that, when found as a whitespace-separated word, abort the
      call. Mostly POSIX-flavoured but the Windows-specific ones
      (del / erase / rd / rmdir / format / attrib / takeown / icacls /
       cacls / runas / reg) live in the same list because cmd.exe and
      PowerShell both interpret them when shell_exec runs on Windows.
      A few names overlap with legitimate non-shell uses (e.g. "kill"
      can appear inside a file path); the cost is acceptable since the
      tokenizer splits on whitespace + shell metacharacters, so only
      stand-alone tokens trigger the match.

      cd / chdir / pushd / popd are NOT in here — they live in
      WorkspaceEscapeTokens below, which is checked only when the
      workspace restriction is active. Banning the cd-family
