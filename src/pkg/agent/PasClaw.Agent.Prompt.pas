(*
  PasClaw.Agent.Prompt - composes the system prompt from layered
  sections (identity, runtime, workspace, memory, skill catalog, rules,
  user-supplied additions), in the style picoclaw and nanobot use.

  The whole motivation here is that the LLM never knew anything about
  itself before — PasClaw was sending whatever single string the caller
  put into Options.SystemPrompt and nothing else. Picoclaw and nanobot
  both compose a richer prompt out of workspace context, memory, and
  skill metadata, joined by "\n\n---\n\n" so each section is visually
  delimited in the model's input.

  Single entry point:

    BuildSystemPrompt(Cfg, UserSys) : string

  Sections emitted, in order, skipping any that are empty:

    1. IDENTITY      - "You are PasClaw, the best 10x programmer..." +
                       version + runtime string. Always present.
    2. WORKSPACE     - paths the model can rely on inside ~/.pasclaw.
                       Always present.
    3. MEMORY        - contents of <home>/workspace/memory/MEMORY.md if
                       the file exists. Lets the user pin facts that
                       persist across sessions.
    4. SKILLS        - one line per registered skill manifest, pulled
                       from PasClaw.Skills.Loader. Only emitted when the
                       user actually has skills installed.
    5. RULES         - the same set of behavioral rules picoclaw uses
                       (use tools, be precise, verify, update memory).
                       Always present.
    6. USER          - whatever the caller passed via --system /
                       TPasClawAgent.SystemPrompt / etc. Appended last
                       so it can override or extend the built-ins by
                       virtue of recency in the prompt.

  Sections are joined by Sep = sLineBreak + sLineBreak + '---' +
  sLineBreak + sLineBreak so the model sees them as clear
  horizontal-rule-separated blocks (matches picoclaw's
  renderPromptPartsLegacy and nanobot's build_system_prompt joiner).

  No I/O is required to use the result. Memory and skill catalog reads
  swallow their errors — a missing MEMORY.md or a misconfigured skill
  manifest just means that section is skipped, not a hard failure.

{ Returns the fully-composed system prompt. UserSys is appended verbatim
  as the final section if non-empty. Pass '' if there's nothing extra.

  ToolsEnabled controls whether tool-dependent sections (the skill
  catalog, the "ALWAYS use tools" rule, the truncated-fs_write rule,
  the verify-by-running-checks rule, the update-MEMORY.md rule) are
  emitted. Callers running `--no-tools` (or constructing the component
  with UseTools=False) MUST pass False here — otherwise the prompt
  tells the model to call tools that the tool loop will refuse to
  pass through, producing a confused conversation. Identity, workspace
  paths, and memory contents stay in either mode since they are useful
  as context even without tools available. }

  send only a user message get our identity preamble for free. }
